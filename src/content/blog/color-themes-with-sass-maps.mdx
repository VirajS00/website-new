import AnchorElement from "../../components/markdown-components/anchor-element.astro";
import Example from "../../components/markdown-components/example.astro";

export const components = { a: AnchorElement };

This project was a small but fun project that I did. It involved creating a SASS Map which was used to generate different classes based on the theme names from the map. You can check out the project [here](https://sass-custom-themes.netlify.app/).

<Example>
	in case you're wondering about the `hsl(216 100% 12% / 0.8)` color syntax, it
	is equivilant to `hsla(216, 100%, 12%, 0.8)`. This is the new color syntax for
	CSS, notice how its `hsl` not `hsla` now.
</Example>

Here is an example of one theme:

```sass
winterday: (
	body: (
		bg: hsl(195 100% 95%),
	),
	contentContainer: (
		bg: hsl(195 49% 80%),
		text: hsl(216 100% 14%),
		title: hsl(216 100% 19%),
	),
	button: (
		bg: hsl(216 100% 12% / 0.8),
		bgHover: hsl(216 100% 12% / 1),
		text: hsl(213 100% 94%),
	),
	tooltip: (
		bg: hsl(0 0% 0% / 0.8),
		text: #e7f9ff,
	)
);
```

Here is the loop I wrote to loop through the themes and create classes:

```scss
@each $theme, $components in $colours {
	.#{$theme} {
		@each $component, $value in $components {
			@each $prop, $value in $value {
				--clr-#{$component}-#{$prop}: #{$value};
			}
		}
	}
}
```

And here is the generated output CSS:

```css
.winterDay {
	--clr-body-bg: #e6f9ff;
	--clr-contentContainer-bg: #b3d8e5;
	--clr-contentContainer-text: #001d47;
	--clr-contentContainer-title: #002761;
	--clr-button-bg: rgba(0, 24, 61, 0.8);
	--clr-button-bgHover: #00183d;
	--clr-button-text: #e0eeff;
	--clr-tooltip-bg: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);
	--clr-tooltip-text: #e7f9ff;
}
```

The themes chosen by the user are also stored in localstorage to retain the state when the user selects a theme and reloads the page.

This was a fun project and hope to do more projects using SASS.
