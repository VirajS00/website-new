This project was a fun project I Did where I tried to replicate some brand and app logos in HTML and CSS. The two logos on the right are made using CSS. You can check out the project here. ',

It was a fun project and took some time to do since whenever I wanted to work on it, I was working on it in the middle. This project first involved which logos can be replicated, the complexity of the logo went up as I added more. One thing that helped me in making these logos is breaking them down into basic shapes and then come down to coding them.

I took a help of a few resources such as a gradient generator by and a page by which explained how to make basic shapes in css which was very helpful.

```css
.triangle {
	height: 0;
	width: 0;
	border: 50px solid transparent;
	border-top-color: red;
}
```

Overall it was a fun project and might add more logos to it.
