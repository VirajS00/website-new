import { Triangle } from "../../components/articles/triangle";
import { SolidGradientExample } from "../../components/articles/solid-gradient";

This started with a [CSS tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/) and a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3LXA6duP5g) by Web Dev Simplified in which they made basic shapes with CSS.
I decided to repliate vector app icons.

For this project, I tried to replicate some brand and app logos in HTML and CSS. You can check out the project [here](https://virajs00.github.io/css-logos/).

The project uses `CSS custom properties` to make sizing easier along with `calc()` to make everything scale to the desired size.

```css
:root {
	--logo-size: 200px;
}

.logo {
	height: var(--logo-size);
	width: var(--logo-size);

	/* border using calc */
	border: calc(var(--logo-size) * 0.03) solid #ccc;
	border-radius: calc(var(--logo-size) * 0.15);
}
```

The `calc()` function in css allows us to calculate things. It is a great tool to help out with making things in css. You can learn more about the `calc()` function here which is a video by YouTuber Kevin Powell, his channel is a great resource for CSS.

The other thing that was interesting is the creation of basic shapes in css such as a triangle, trapezium, etc which is well explained in this [CSS tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/the-shapes-of-css/).

For example you can use borders to create triangles (this with create an upward facing triangle):

```css
.triangle {
	width: 0;
	height: 0;
	border: 100px solid transparent;
	border-bottom: 100px solid red;
}
```

The setting width and height to “0” is super important since otherwise it will not look like a triangle. Move the slider below to see the border thickness chnage.

_This is why you can use borders as triangles._

There was also one more trick I used pertaining to gradients where you can get a hard stop to a gradient when the end of another colour is the start of the next one.

```css
.gradient-hard {
	width: 100px;
	height: 100px;
	background-image: linear-gradient(green 20%, blue 20% 60%, white 60%);
}
```

You can also do that same with `radial-gradient` and it can create hard stops between 2 circles. Since a gradient is a `background-image`, you can play around with the `background-position` and `background-size` properties as well to create patterns with it.
