import { Picture } from "@astrojs/image/components";

This was a very unique website design idea, we went through multiple iterations and decided that the desktop version of the website will flow horizontally.

## The Design

Making the website flow horizontally was a big challenge for responsiveness where I had to figure out where the website will break and make a horizontal design for it.

The design process went through multiple iterations and we finally came up with a design that worked.

<Picture
	src='/blog/pictures/studio1.png'
	class='img-bg'
	widths={[1000]}
	formats={["avif", "webp", "jpg"]}
	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='250:161'
	fit='cover'
/>

There is also an overlay on the homepage which was initially hand drawn and then traced in vector form.

The rest of the site also flows horizontally on the desktop.
