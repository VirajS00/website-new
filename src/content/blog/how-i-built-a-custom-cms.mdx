import { Picture } from "@astrojs/image/components";
import AnchorElement from "../../components/markdown-components/anchor-element.astro";

export const components = { a: AnchorElement };

This is an Admin Page/Content Management system I made for my (old) website. This is made in PHP, MySQL.

You can find the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/VirajS00/WebAdmin) here.

This project started out with the analytics, I wanted to create the analytics myself. I got the browser name, operating system and device type using the `$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']` super global in PHP.
I got the page the user is on using `$_SERVER[\'PHP_SELF\']`. For the country I used `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']`and then queried an [API](https://www.geoplugin.com/).
To graph out the analytics on the homepage of the admin, I used [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

Got the data from php where I exported it as json imported it into JavaScript using the `fetch()` API built into the browser and created the charts.

	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='219:200'
	fit='cover'
	style='max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;'
/>

For the "Photos" and "Other Content" page, I got the data in using PHP and then used a script which I created with the help of this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfYWwQrtzzY) by Web Dev Simplified on YouTube for rearranging the photos,
then using `fetch()`, I linked it to PHP to update the MySQL database.

	class='img-bg'
	widths={[800]}
	formats={["avif", "webp", "jpg"]}
	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='139:100'
	fit='cover'
	style='max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;'
/>

In the upload pages, the image upload buttons get a loader when you select an image, the images are uploaded in a separate form and an `<input type='hidden'>` gets updated for putting them in the database.

<Picture
	src='/blog/pictures/image-admin-3.png'
	class='img-bg'
	widths={[800]}
	formats={["avif", "webp", "jpg"]}
	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='390:400'
	fit='cover'
	style='max-width: 00px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;'
/>

The other content also has platforms which can be added and removed with the help of the platforms page.

<Picture
	src='/blog/pictures/image-admin-4.png'
	class='img-bg'
	widths={[600]}
	formats={["avif", "webp", "jpg"]}
	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='482:400'
	fit='cover'
	style='max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;'
/>

I also create a rich TextArea myself. This was a mini project in of itself. I used the javascript `execCommand()` API to create all the functions of the TextArea. I created an content editable `<iframe>` and executed all the commands in it, at the end parsed the HTML inside the iframe using the following code:

```js
// Grab the form and add an event listener to it to listen for its submission
document.querySelector("form").addEventListener("submit", (e) => {
	// Grab the textarea
	const inputtext = document.querySelector(".inputText");
	// Prevent the form from getting submitted
	e.preventDefault();
	// add the HTML to the textarea
	inputtext.value = "";
	inputtext.value = doc.body.innerHTML;
	// submit the form
	document.getElementById("other-form").submit();
});
```

One challenge that I faced when making the platforms page is that, there is HTML code in the database and I wanted to display the images. The path in the `<img>` tag is relative to the otherContent.php page which is in the parent folder. I wrote the following function in JavaScript to counter that.

```js
const changePaths = () => {
	// get the path for the platform image tag
	const platformImg = document.querySelectorAll(".platformimg");
	// loop through all platform img tags
	platformImg.forEach((img) => {
		const src = img.getAttribute("src");
		// Create the new source
		const newSrc = "../" + src;
		// Set the new source
		img.setAttribute("src", newSrc);
	});
};
```

`<iframe>` and executed all the commands in it, at the end parsed the HTML inside the I also added a hit counter. For duplicate counts I created a session variable and if that exists, it will not count hits. Got the code from this [stack overflow article](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18959592/php-only-hit-counter).

```php
function countHits() {
    session_start();
    if(empty($_SESSION['visited'])){
        $counter = file_get_contents('./hits.txt') + 1;
        file_put_contents('./hits.txt', $counter);
    }
    $_SESSION['visited'] = true;
}
```

For the feedback page, I'm just putting user feedback in the database and presenting it in the admin page as cards.

	class='img-bg'
	widths={[600]}
	formats={["avif", "webp", "jpg"]}
	alt='Layouts'
	aspectRatio='250:167'
	fit='cover'
	style='max-width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;'
/>

Overall it was a big project but it was fun to do and I learned a lot from it as well.
